# What is a computer?

 
A **computer** is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.


## Hardware vs. software

> **Hardware** is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts.
> **Software** is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.

### binary and data

Computers use **binary** - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data. A **binary** digit, or bit, is the smallest unit of data in computing. It is represented by a 0 or a 1. **Binary** numbers are made up of binary digits (bits), eg the binary number 1001.

All software, music, documents, and any other information that is processed by a computer, is also stored using **binary**.
